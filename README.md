# Simple-Note
**My approach**

* Learn Jetpack compose, design and write UI with mock data.
* Learn Firebase Realtime Database and design database.
* Choose architectural pattern (MVVM) and dependency injection library (Hilt).
* Write and test a sample feature with real database.
* Write other features and regression test.
* Review code.

**Time**

* 1 day to learn Jetpack compose and write UI.
* 1 day to integrate with real database and  write sample feature (save new note on Firebase database).
* 1 day to write other features and regression test.
